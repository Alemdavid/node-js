1. Classes
Classes are simply a template for creating objects. They function similarly to classes in other object-oriented languages, defining the properties and behaviors an object will have.

2. Arrow Functions
Arrow functions in Node.js introduce concise body syntax or implicit return.
In Node.js, variables can be declared using let, const, and var:

let: This declares a variable that can be reassigned.

const: This declares a constant variable that cannot be reassigned.

var: This declares a variable that can also be reassigned, but its scope differs from let and const.

3. Array Methods
Arrays come with several built-in methods to manipulate and transform their elements. Some examples are:

push(): Adds one or more elements to the end of an array.

pop(): Removes the last element from an array.

shift(): Removes the first element from an array.

unshift(): Adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array.

map(): Returns a new array by applying a function to each element.

filter(): Creates a new array with elements that pass a function's test.

reduce(): Reduces an array to a single value by applying a function to each element.

4. Destructuring
Destructuring in Node.js is a technique used to extract values from arrays or objects and assign them to individual variables.

5. Cube of a Number
To find the cube of a number, multiply the thrice  by itself.

6. Function to Find the Area of a Rectangle
To calculate the area of a rectangle, you need the length and breadth, then multiply them together (Area = Length Ã— Breadth).

7. Variable Declarations
There are three main ways to declare variables: const, let, and var.

8. Modules
Modules are reusable pieces of code that are packaged in a single file or multiple files and can be imported as needed in different parts of an application.
